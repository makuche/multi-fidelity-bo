This folder contains scripts that I have used throughout my thesis work but not to create the contents of the thesis.

```text
plot_local_minima_convergence.py        #  Tracking the local minima, useful to track convergence of the response surface
plot_loss_functions.py                  #  Functionalities to plot what is called 'regret' in the thesis
plot_baseline_tl_comparison.py          #  Plot of 'regret' with mean and variance over a batch of experiments
plot_TL_convergence.py                  #  Alternative plot style to visualize TL results
