# CEST project template

A generic template for projects in CEST group. Clone this git-repository and
use it as a starting point for organizing data in your project.

In detail
1. Clone the base repository for your local use: `git clone https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/vhavu/cest-project-template.git/`
2. You can rename your copy of the repository and add directories for better organization of your data but keep the cloned struture as a basic template.
3. You can't push anything to the repository. If you want to remove all references to the template you can do this with `rm -rf .git/`


## Directory structure
This is a suggestion for a minimal directory structure suitable for different project types.

The core strucutre:
```text
|- data           <- Any data associated with the project, generated by you or others.
    |- processed  <- Processed data (e.g, databases of DFT calculations) 
    |- raw        <- Raw, immutable (!), data to be further processed (e.g. Atomic structures, DFT calculations)
|
|- doc            <- Code documentation for the contents of src/
|
|- references     <- Useful papers, manuals, other explanatory material.
|
|- results        <- Main results including figures, tables, animations, etc.
|
|- scripts        <- Any scripts or notebooks associated with the project (bash, python...).
|
|- src            <- Source code (C, fortran, Python...) for any libraries or modules developed as part of the project.
```
If a project only involves light scripting that can be sufficiently documented by comments and/or README,
the src and doc folder can be omitted.

Other stuff that may be useful:
```text
|- LICENSE        <- A license for your project if needed.
|
|- Makefile       <- A (Make, snakemake...) makefile that builds your code, or generates a dataset etc.
|
|- models         <- For ML projects: trained and serialized machine learning models, summaries thereof etc.
|
```
In addition to such a template it is possible to maintain an associated Overleaf document where generated figures, tables etc are continually updated.
This document can also serve as a basis for a future publication.
