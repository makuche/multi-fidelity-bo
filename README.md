## Directory structure
This is a suggestion for a minimal directory structure suitable for different project types.

The core structure:
```text
|- data           <- Any data associated with the project, generated by you or others.
    |- processed  <- Processed data (e.g, databases of DFT calculations) 
    |- raw        <- Raw, immutable (!), data to be further processed (e.g. Atomic structures, DFT calculations)
|
|- doc            <- Code documentation for the contents of src/
|
|- references     <- Useful papers, manuals, other explanatory material.
|
|- results        <- Main results including figures, tables, animations, etc.
|
|- scripts        <- Any scripts or notebooks associated with the project (bash, python...).
```
